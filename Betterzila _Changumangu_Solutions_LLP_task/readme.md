# PDFQueryApp

Welcome to the PDFQueryApp! This application allows users to upload a PDF, extract its content, and ask queries related to the PDF. The application uses Langchain's PDF loader to extract content, Hugging Face API for text embeddings, and a Faiss vector database for efficient querying.

- `llm_basics.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with basics for developing the application.
- `main.py`: Contains the Streamlit application code.
- `helper.py`: Includes functions for data loading, text processing, vectorization, and Faiss indexing.
- `.env`: Store your API keys or any sensitive information here. This file should be kept private.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the required dependencies for your project.
