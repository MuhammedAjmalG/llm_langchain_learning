# Large Language Model Evaluation with Phoenix Library

This repository contains an example project on how to observe and evaluate a large language model (LLM) using the Phoenix library by Arize. The vector store used is Faiss, and the LLM is accessed through the Groq API. Additionally, libraries like UMAP, HDBSCAN, and Plotly are utilized for visualization and analysis.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to effectively observe and evaluate the performance of a large language model using various tools and libraries. By leveraging the Phoenix library by Arize and the Groq API, the project provides insights into the model's behavior and performance metrics. Visualization and clustering techniques are employed to enhance the evaluation process.

## Features

- Integration with Phoenix library by Arize for model evaluation.
- Vector storage using Faiss for efficient similarity search.
- Access to LLM through Groq API.
- Dimensionality reduction using UMAP.
- Clustering with HDBSCAN.
- Interactive visualizations with Plotly.
